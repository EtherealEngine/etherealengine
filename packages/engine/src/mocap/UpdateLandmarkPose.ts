- what exactly are
    readonly LeftShoulder: "leftShoulder";
    readonly LeftUpperArm: "leftUpperArm";
    readonly LeftLowerArm: "leftLowerArm";
    readonly LeftHand: "leftHand";
    are these all joints? or is one of them an actual arm?

- what tells the animation system to stop animating the body? why does it do that sometimes? what am i doing at my end that forces it into that state?
  maybe it depends on if the camera starts up right away or not?
  or maybe if i just start moving too early before assets load?

- i notice the animation system leaps to a t pose sometimes - why? especially if i pause the execution in js debugger

- i notice a spring system in vrm - what is it?
- what are the rest bone positions for a given rig??? i am grabbing them at startup - is that the best way?
- can i interpolate, or collect initial bone positions?
- what are default positions?
- what does it mean that bones are sometimes normalized?
- does upper arm refer to the arm itself or the joint?

- OVERALL ROTATION

  - rotating hips does not rotate the entire avatar root node - do we want to do that?
  - default hips pose is x=3.089, y=0.090, z=-3.081 ... ... whereas "zero" for me is 0,0,0 ... 

- HIPS

  ! hips/shoulders must be estimated correctly or else everything else gets thrown off
  ! hip orientation (yawpitchroll()) is off axis a bit; it makes avatar look drunk
  ? can we use the shoulder midpoint to improve? cross the hip horizontal with the spine?
  ? can we improve forward pitch estimation using z depth between shoulder and hip?
  ? what if i put the entire rig on soft physics springs and then allow parts to tug around?
  ? Does it even make sense to be computing each of these bones by hand?
  ! If I get hips rotation wrong then everything else is scrambled
  ! I notice that kalikokit pretty much ignores the visibility flags - why? is there something i don't understand?
  ? TEST: It is not clear if low visibility per component == bad/zero data or if it reverts to tensorflow speculation
  ? what level of participant mediated correction can we rely on - can the user know to capture their shoulders?

- ARMS / SHOULDERS

  ! insanely the left and right arms/legs are swapped in the source code; all the english words say left, but the indexes refer to the right
  ? seems like there are assumptions about being upright; how can one estimate arm joint angles from an arbitrary shoulder orientation
  - i need to understand better the frame of reference for the kalidokit shoulder to arm pose estimation - is it local or world?

- REST POSE STRATEGY

  ? if a part is not visible (such as wrists) what is the right strategy?
  ? i thought a good strategy was to return to rest pose but this looks terrible
  ? another strategy was to leave as is - test this more to see if it remains relative to subsequent core hips rotations

- GROUND IMPROVE

  ? hips are normally at 0,0,0 - we can find the inverse of the lowest limb to improve this
  ? what if i simply avoid changing the real rig height; or i find the original rig hip height rest position?
  ? can i cache the lowest feature temporally so that a person can jump in the air?
  ? does visibility matter for finding lowest feature?

- IK IMPROVE

  ! hips must be correct!
  ? should i do ik in world space or local space?
  - test feeding the ik with the manually approximated estimated joint rotations and positions

- try new pose algo
- test fixed hands
- test multiple cameras
