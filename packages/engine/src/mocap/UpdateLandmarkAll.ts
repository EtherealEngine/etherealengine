NOTES Aug 2023

on lm3d normalized data:
  - all points are centered on the avatar as a vitrivian man with radius 0.5 or diameter 1
  - for example the left shoulder is often at 0.14 in the x axis and the right shoulder is at -0.14
  - raw data y is negative upwards, so the shoulder y is at -0.45; which is the opposite of the 3js convention
  - z pose estimates are poor from the front, we don't really know exactly where the wrists are in 3d space; you could be punching forward for example at full extent, or have a hand on your chest
  - raw z data does exist but fairly weak; good enough for hips pirouette however
  - note that 'visibility' also is slightly unclear as a concept; tensorflow appears to speculate even if no visibility

MAIN GOALS

  - flip hands? I tried to do this but failed; failed to flip some coordinate somewhere in the math
  - merge change list with restpose logic?
  - support the concept of jumping by using latency of ground pose estimation
  - support real wingspan estimation

HEAD ISSUES

  x head pose works ok
  ? it could possibly be improved though; maybe slower updates?
  ? maybe write to neck as well as the head?

HIPS ISSUES

  x default hips pose from vrm model is x=3.089, y=0.090, z=-3.081 ... ... whereas "zero" for me is 0,0,0 ... use vrm model as rest pose?
  x hips/shoulders must be estimated correctly or else everything else gets thrown off
  x hip orientation (yawpitchroll()) is off axis a bit; it makes avatar look drunk
  x can we use the shoulder midpoint to improve? cross the hip horizontal with the spine?
  x can we improve forward pitch estimation using z depth between shoulder and hip?
  ? what if i put the entire rig on soft physics springs and then allow parts to tug around?
  ? Does it even make sense to be computing the hips by hand?
  ? I notice that kalikokit pretty much ignores the visibility flags - why? is there something i don't understand?
  ? TEST: It is not clear if low visibility per component == bad/zero data or if it reverts to tensorflow speculation
  ? what level of participant mediated correction can we rely on - can the user know to capture their shoulders?
  ? rotating hips does not rotate the entire avatar root node - do we want to do that?

ARMS / SHOULDERS ISSUES

  !!! insanely the left and right arms/legs are swapped in the source code; all the english words say left, but the indexes refer to the right
  ? see https://github.com/yeemachine/kalidokit/blob/main/src/PoseSolver/calcHips.ts
  ? seems like there are assumptions about being upright; how can one estimate arm joint angles from an arbitrary shoulder orientation?
  ? i need to understand better the frame of reference for the kalidokit shoulder to arm pose estimation - is it local or world?
  ? if a part is not shown (such as wrists) what is the right strategy? revert to rest pose or leave it as is? what happens if you then rotate your body?

FINGERS
  - test fingers once that is merged again

GROUND IMPROVE

  x hips are normally at 0,0,0 - we can find the inverse of the lowest limb to improve this
  x what if i simply avoid changing the real rig height; or i find the original rig hip height rest position?
  ? can i cache the lowest feature temporally so that a person can jump in the air?
  ? does visibility matter for finding lowest feature?

IK IMPROVE

  - @todo since ik fights with direct pose setting - set the direct stuff via ik now instead - but also get the support fixed for both
  - @todo the hands orientation is not being set - set it
  - turn on ik again
  - test feeding the ik with the manually approximated estimated joint rotations and positions
  - we need a way to use IK AND ordinary coercion of features such as elbows?
  ? should i do ik in world space or local space? do i even have the option?
  - can i set state on the vrm rig and then have all changelists consolidated in the animation system?

OTHER LATER

  - test multiple cameras <- this is probably the best thing we could do actually
  - try new pose algo from mediapipe that is more recent than holistic
  - may still be worth trying hip rotations using 2d landmark data - it may have paradoxically better z depth
  - review this approach in detail: https://github.com/ju1ce/Mediapipe-VR-Fullbody-Tracking/blob/main/bin/inference_gui.py 

RANDOM QUESTIONS

  - what exactly are these really??? are these all joints? or is one of them an actual arm?
      readonly LeftShoulder: "leftShoulder";
      readonly LeftUpperArm: "leftUpperArm";
      readonly LeftLowerArm: "leftLowerArm";
      readonly LeftHand: "leftHand";

  - i notice a spring system in vrm - what is it?
  - what are the rest bone positions for a given rig??? i am grabbing them at startup - is that the best way?
  - what does it mean that bones are 'normalized'?
  - the body seems to jump or something when i remove an ik??? why???
