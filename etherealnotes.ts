issues:

- the body seems to jump or something when i remove an ik
- what is the scale of the puppet? is it 1? or 1.5? wingspan
- rotate head
- pivot hips

notes re normalized data:
  - all points are centered on the avatar as a vitrivian man with radius 0.5 or diameter 1
  - for example the left shoulder is often at 0.14 in the x axis and the right shoulder is at -0.14
  - raw data y is negative upwards, so the shoulder y is at -0.45; which is the opposite of the 3js convention

notes re z depth
  - z pose estimates are poor from the front, we don't really know exactly where the wrists are in 3d space; you could be punching forward for example at full extent, or have a hand on your chest
  - raw z data doesn't seem to really change - it is unclear
  - but we *do* have an elbow; and we also know that the elbow typically is forward of the chest because the shoulder joint doesn't go back very far; we can estimate elbow pose
  - given an elbow pose it is arguable that we could estimate the wrist z position also???

notes re scaling to real puppet
  - we have to make sure that we multiply by the real world wingspan of a real person - definitely larger than 1 meter? but it doesn't seem to be much larger?

notes re visibility
  - there is pretty much always data; just a threshhold, 0.3 seems like a good throw-away threshhold
